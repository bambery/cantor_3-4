# Cantor-like Sets

Taking the interval [0,1], divide the interval into four equal intervals, and remove the third, leaving two intervals of length 1/2 and 1/4 respectively.

to see the first three iterations:

## next steps
- generalize for taking 2/4
- investigate generalizing for aribitrary intervals for dividing and taking, ie divide into 5ths, take only 2/5, take 2/5 and 3/5, take only 3/5.

## excuses
It's been a hot minute since I wrote Javascript, and I am spoiled for Python. Need to brush up my skills and get back into the swing of the syntax.
